Mortality Data Sources and Results

Using RISMAT is predicated upon life expectancy/mortality data.  One recommended source is www.mortality.org.  I attempted to create an account there on 5/14/22 using my IEEE account, but got no reply.  

After I get the 1x1 matrix data, I should fit an exponential curve to the data going back to age 60 (or maybe 65, because that looks like it might be an inflection point), and moving forward to, say, 100, and do it for both males and females.  This data can be used to develop the curves and curve fits in the Longetivity section (chapter 3)

Or, maybe I can skip all that, and follow the data from e.g. the data used by pension plan annuitites that slices the data differently and looks at categories like 'white collar annuitants' (us) which have lower mortality rates up to about age 95 than the population in general.  Sharp points out that this data may be biased by self selection where healthy individuals tend to select life annuities while those with possibly severe health problems often take a lump sum payout.

Sharpe's conclusion is that for those of us w/substantial retirement savings should use the SOA mortality estimats (chapter 3 page 13).  Thus, the data needed is available in the MIM-2021 model and associated excel-based too at https://www.soa.org/resources/research-reports/2021/mortality-improvement-model/.

Things to check:

- [ ] I have no 457 plan money in my Fidelity account.
- [ ] Get updated mortality data
- [ ] Does Kris have two Vanguard accounts?
